# Trip Share
A full-stack MERN website that allows users to share traveling photos and experiences. 

The front-end view is set up using React.js, while the back-end is constructed using Node.js to provide RESTful APIs and interact with the MongoDB Atlas database.

# Prerequisites
**Node v16.13.0: Ensure you have this version installed to avoid compatibility issues.**

**Google Map API**

**MongoDB (Atlas free version)**
# Testing
**Postman**: Recommended for testing the API endpoints to ensure they function correctly before integrating with the front-end.
